# CSF-RedCamp

Lab created to teach students web vulnerabilities.

## To Do

- [x] Add success message once transfer is complete
- [ ] Beautify up the UI

## To Consider

- [x] Logout button, so we don't need to access the /reset endpoint everytime we want to swap accounts
- [x] Account indicator, so users can easily identify account they are logged in as in the dashboard page
